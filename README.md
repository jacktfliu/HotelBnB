# Technologies
HotelBnB is built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend. HotelBnB also utilizes JavaScript, React and Redux for the frontend state management. Styling is implemented with CSS and HTML5. Google Maps API is used to render maps on the application. AWS is used to host photos uploaded and photos seeded. 

# Features

User Authentication
Users are able to login and signup via a modal on any page that has a navbar. The users credentials is then authenticated through the backend and would display the appropiate response error messages to the user. A demo user was implemented to bypass signing up.
