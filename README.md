# Technologies
HotelBnB is built with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL on the backend. HotelBnB also utilizes JavaScript, React and Redux for the frontend state management. Styling is implemented with CSS and HTML5. Google Maps API is used to render maps on the application.

# Features

User Authentication
Users are able to login and signup via a modal on any page that has a navbar. The users credentials is then authenticated through the backend and would display the appropiate response error messages to the user. A demo user was implemented to bypass signing up.

Listing 
Logged in users are able to create listings, update and delete listings. Users who are creating a listing are able to upload up to five photos through AWS intergration. Once a listing is created, users are able to go back and edit their listings as they deem fit.
